## about pix

Pix brings a new and exciting twist to the sticker photo booths found in Japan, bringing them to the World Wide Web. A company looking to break into the social media scene, while making a unique statement, would be interested in the development of this app. Pix incorporates the nostalgia of pixel art with the fun, spontaneous, and colourful feel of sticker photo booths. This combination of new and old in Pix would appeal to young and old users alike, fostering a fun, light-hearted photo-sharing community.

## instructions
